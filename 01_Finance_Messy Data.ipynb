    "# Normalizing Messy Financial Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Financial Analyst, most of my work takes place in Excel and one of my monthly routines is to consolidate financial information from various, remote business units; I achieve this by providing each business unit with an Excel template that is to be filled out. Unfortunately, since most data is user-inputted, I often receive excel templates that have typos, miscategorizations, and other errors that make consolidation a nightmare. Unfortunately,  excel isn't powerful enough to handle most unstructured data. However, we can leverage Python to identify and correct user-inputted errors fairly easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The packages that we'll use in this tutorial are the following:\n",
    "- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    " - Helps import and manipulate csv data\n",
    "- [pandasql](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pandasql)\n",
    " - Performs queries on csv data\n",
    "- [fuzzywuzzy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fuzzywuzzy)\n",
    " - Assists with analyzing text data\n",
    "- [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/)\n",
    " - Enables writing to excel\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "Before we begin, it might be worth digging into the details of our problem and our proposed solution - taking time to plan may pay dividends in the near future. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us consider the incoming data. As previously mentioned, users are submitting financial data; the financial data includes the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fiscal Year (i.e \"2016\"\n",
    "- Fiscal Month (i.e \"01\" = January)\n",
    "- Expense Detail (e.g \"Board of Director Fees\"... or in some cases \"Broad Fees\" [typo implied])\n",
    "- Expense value ($)\n",
    "\n",
    "While most of the aforementioned information is fairly straight forward, I often see errors within the \"Expense Detail\" field. The \"Expense Detail\" is merely a description of the type of expense - often, the type of expense is subjective to the accountants' interpretation. As a result, I often see similar but *slightly* nonstandardized expense categories (thus causing a problem during consolidation). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Approach\n",
    "In order to reconcile variations in \"Expense Details\", we'll have to declare standard, `accepted` values. The `accepted` values will be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Severance'\n",
    "- 'Legal Fees'\n",
    "- 'Import & Export Fees'\n",
    "- 'I.T. Fees'\n",
    "- 'Board Fees'\n",
    "- 'Acquisition Fees'\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user-inputted Expense will be compared against the 'accepted' values. If the user inputs are closely related, we will replace the original, user-inputted value with our `accepted` value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll append the the `corrected_expense` into the original excel file so that we can pass along to our colleagues for reporting purposes :) \n"

Of course, not every string is *exactly* the same, therefore fuzzywuzzy will assign a score from 0 to 100 (where 100 is an absolute, perfect match). We will take advantage of fuzzywuzzy's scoring system to determine whether or not a user-inputted Expense matches our `accepted` values. \n",

However, there are [other methods](http://chairnerd.seatgeek.com/fuzzywuzzy-fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/) associated with fuzzywuzzy that might be more applicable depending on you specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE 2**: Below I've used the `.apply` method to iterate through our current dataframe. As defined, we will only accept `correctMatch`es if the `token_set_ratio` is > `40`. Any value that falls below the `40` threshold will return `N/A`, an indicator for additional investigation. "

Furthermore, I hope I've piqued your interest in Python and illustrated the capabilities Python has over Excel. Finally, please excuse my messy code - I am sure it can be improved (and I continuously strive to improve my programming skills) - given more time I could develop a much more robust process. However, currently the previously detailed process is sufficient for this tutorial's purpose :)\n",

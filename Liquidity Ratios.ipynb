    "\n",
    "In our previous lesson, we learned about [Cash Conversion Cycles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cash-king-calculating-conversion-cycles-determine-companys-jon-placa), an [Efficiency Ratio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficiencyratio.asp) used to express the time length required to create, sell, and collect payables on inventory. However, Efficiency Ratios are only one four Financial ratio categories (i.e [efficiency, liquidity, solvency, and profitability](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/four-basic-types-financial-ratios-used-measure-companys-performance-25299.html)). The following tutorial will focus on [Liquidity Ratios](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidityratios.asp) - measurements used to identify potential short-terms financing risks. \n",

    "In our examples, we will be using Boeing's ([BA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=BA&ei=lDP1WNGdJdWHsQGBzYe4CA)) financial statements to produce our liquidity ratios. Information will be obtained using [Quandl's API](https://github.com/quandl/quandl-python).\n"

    "In this tutorial we've review one category of Financial Ratios, Liquidity Ratios. In the subset of Liquidity Ratios, there are various calculations - some more conservative than others. Each Ratio has a specific purpose but indicates a company's relative financial health. Note, as always, a company's financial ratio must be compared to the industry averages. Finally, while these ratios may seem overly simplistic, they are well-tested, trusted, and valuable when analyzing any company."
